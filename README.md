# automate local files
A simple script that can download a mp3 file embbeded with basic metadata (ex. title, album artwork, track number, ect...) from the youtube link of a song. 
I use it to upload songs that are not available on any streaming services/music platforms to my Spotify local file library! [NOT DONE YET]
